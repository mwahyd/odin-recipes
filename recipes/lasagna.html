    <h3>For the meat sauce:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tsp extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>500g ground beef</li>
        <li>1 medium onion</li>
        <li>1 large bell pepper (red or yellow), diced</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 can crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 can tomato sauce (or passata)</li>
        <li>50g tomato paste</li>
        <li>2 tbsp chopped fresh oregano, or 2 tsp dried oregano</li>
        <li>1/4 cup fresh parsley</li>
        <li>1 tbsp italian seasoning</li>
        <li>1 tbsp sugar (optional)</li>
        <li>Black pepper (to taste)</li>
        <li>1 tbsp salt (or to taste)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>To assemble the lasagna:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>250g dry lasagna sheets (9 lasagna sheets - unbroken)</li>
        <li>150g ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>500g mozzarella cheese, grated or sliced</li>
        <li>100g grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Method</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Brown the minced beef</li>
        <p>In a large pot heat 1 tbsp of olive oil on medium high heat. Add the minced beef and cook until it is
            lightly browned on all sides.</p>
        <p>Once, it is lightly browned, remove the beef using a slotted spoon to a bowl. Drain off all but a tablespoon
            of fat. </p>
        <li>Cooking everything else</li>
        <p>Add the onion and garlic to the pot and cook until the onion becomes translucent and fragrant (about 4
            minutes on medium heat). Add the ground beef back to the pan with the diced peppers. Stir to mix everything,
            reduce the heat and cook further for another 5 minutes.</p>
        <li>Boil water</li>
        <p>Put a large pot of salted water (1 tsp for 500g of water) on the stove on high heat. Make sure to cover the
            pot with a lid to speed up the process. This will be your pasta water.</p>
        <li>Time for all the tomatoes!</li>
        <p>Add the crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce (or passata) and tomato paste to the pot. Then give it a good stir to
            mix.</p>
        <p>Add all the herbs and seasonings. Then take one of the tomato cans and fill it to half with cold water and
            add it to the pot and stir. Adjust any seasoning to taste.</p>
        <p>Bring the sauce to a simmer and lower the heat to maintain a low simmer. Cook for 30 to 45 minutes, stirring
            periodically. <strong>NOTE:</strong> scrape the bottom to prevent anything from sticking to the bottom and
            scorching.
        </p>
        <p>Once the sauce has simmered and is nice and viscous, remove from the heat.</p>
        <li>Boil and drain the lasagna sheets</li>
        <p>By now the salted water you started heating in step one should be boiling. Add the dry lasagna lasagna sheet
            and
            cook them to al dente, per package directions. (Note lasagna sheet may be cooked in advance.)</p>
        <p>Stir often to prevent from sticking. Make sure that water remains at a full rolling boil during the entire
            cooking to prevent lasagna sheet from sticking.</p>
        <p>When ready, drain in a colander and rinse with cool water, gently separating any lasagna sheet that may be
            sticking
            together.</p>
        <p>Spread a little olive oil on a large rimmed baking sheet, and lay out the cooked lasagna sheet on this sheet,
            turning them over so that they get coated with a little of the olive oil. This will prevent them from
            sticking together.</p>
        <li>Heat the oven to 180°C</li>
        <li>Assemble the lasagna</li>
        <p>In a 9x13-inch casserole or lasagna dish, ladle a cup of sauce and spread it over the bottom of the dish.
            Arrange one layer of lasagna noodles lengthwise (about 3 long noodles, edge may overlap, depending on your
            pan) over the sauce. Ladle a third of the remaining sauce over the noodles.</p>
        <p>Sprinkle a layer of a third of the grated mozzarella on top of lasagna sauce. Add half of the ricotta cheese,
            by placing cheese dollops every couple inches. Sprinkle half the grated parmesan cheese evenly over the top
            of ricotta cheese.</p>
        <p>Apply second layer of noodles, top it with half of the remaining sauce. Add half of the remaining Mozzarella,
            the remaining ricotta cheese, and another the remaining Parmesan.</p>
        <p>Finish with another layer of lasagna sheet. Spread the remaining sauce over the top layer of lasagna sheet
            and sprinkle
            with the remaining Mozzarella cheese.</p>
        <li>Bake</li>
        <p>Cover the lasagna tray with aluminium foil, tented slightly so it doesn't touch the lasagna). Bake at 180°C
            for 45 minutes. Uncover in the last 10 minutes if you'd like more of a crusty top or edges.</p>
        <li>Cool and serve</li>
        <p>Allow the lasagna to cool at least 15 before serving. Leftovers will keep for about 5 days. May be reheated
            in conventional oven or microwave. Leave aluminum tent on for storage. (Try to keep the aluminum foil from
            touching the sauce.)</p>
