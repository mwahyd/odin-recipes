        <li>Mushrooms, very thinly sliced if raw, otherwise first sautéed</li>
        <li>Bell peppers, stems and seeds removed, very thinly sliced</li>
        <li>Italian pepperoncini, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>Italian sausage, cooked ahead and crumbled</li>
        <li>Sliced black olives</li>
        <li>Chopped fresh basil</li>
        <li>Baby arugula, tossed in a little olive oil, added as pizza comes out of the oven</li>
        <li>Pesto</li>
        <li>Pepperoni, thinly sliced</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Method</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Proof the yeast</li>
        <p>Place the warm water in the large bowl of a heavy duty stand mixer. Sprinkle the yeast over the warm water
            and
            let it sit for 5 minutes until the yeast is dissolved.</p>
        <p>After 5 minutes stir if the yeast hasn't dissolved completely. The yeast should begin to foam or bloom,
            indicating that the yeast is still active and alive.</p>
        <p>(Note that if you are using "instant yeast" instead of "active yeast", no proofing is required. Just add
            to the flour in the next step.)</p>
        <li>Make and knead the dough</li>
        <p>Add the flour, salt, sugar, and olive oil, and using the mixing paddle attachment, mix on low speed for a
            minute. Then replace the mixing paddle with the dough hook attachment.</p>
        <p>Knead the pizza dough on low to medium speed using the dough hook about 7-10 minutes.</p>
        <p>If you don't have a mixer, you can mix the ingredients together and knead them by hand.</p>
        <p>The dough should be a little sticky, or tacky to the touch. If it's too wet, sprinkle in a little more flour.
        </p>
        <li>Rest and rise</li>
        <p>Spread a thin layer of olive oil over the inside of a large bowl. Place the pizza dough in the bowl and turn
            it around so that it gets coated with the oil.</p>
        <p>At this point you can choose how long you want the dough to ferment and rise. A slow fermentation (24 hours
            in the fridge) will result in more complex flavors in the dough. A quick fermentation (1 1/2 hours in a warm
            place) will allow the dough to rise sufficiently to work with.</p>
        <p>Cover the dough with plastic wrap.</p>
        <p>For a quick rise, place the dough in a warm place (75°F to 85°F) for 1 1/2 hours.</p>
        <p>For a medium rise, place the dough in a regular room temperature place (your kitchen counter will do fine)
            for 8 hours. For a longer rise, chill the dough in the refrigerator for 24 hours (no more than 48 hours).
        </p>
        <p>The longer the rise (to a point) the better the flavor the crust will have</p>
    </ol>
    <h2>Preparing the Pizzas</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the pizza stone</li>
        <li>Divide the dough into 2 balls</li>
        <li>Prep the toppings</li>
        <li>Rollout the dough</li>
        <li>Spread the sauce and add toppings</li>
        <li>Slide pizza into the oven</li>
        <li>Bake</li>
    </ol>
